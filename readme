Unity_Solitaire
Created by Jesse Andringa

This is code was created and written inside the Unity Game Developer, and can used most easily
when integrated into Unities IDE. 

This project is a simple solitaire game that shuffles, deals, and lets you play the classic solitaire game. 

It could be a great starting place if you want to make an advanced game, or if you just want to make your own game for free on your computer or phone.
